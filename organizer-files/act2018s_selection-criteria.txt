Our selection process was quite involved. Nina and I were
responsible for selection, and we based our method on
Emily Riehl's method for selection participants for the
Kan extension seminars. We did roughly what you suggest
above, but here's our method in excruciating detail.  I'll speak about criteria first. The vision of the school
was to bring new faces into the applied category theory
community. So part of the selection process was to
envision what the community could look like, and then to
think about who might not become part of the community
unless they had a  path through programs like this
one. So we considered whether they were junior or
senior, already established in an applied field or a
category theorist. And we thought about the diversity of
the group: whether they were at prestigious universities
or not, whether they had local category theory expertise
or not, whether they were part of any groups underrepresented in the category theory community and if
they would face particular challenges because of it. Within each research team (and indeed within each pair
presenting a paper), we tried to match a junior and a
senior member, with the idea that the senior one could
help mentor the junior and help bring them into the
community. We aimed for each research group to have a couple
of people with research experience, and a couple of
people who had never written a paper before. We aimed
for each group to have a couple of very good category
theorists, and hopefully a couple of people who knew about
the application domain. We also considered the
difficulty of the papers that they were to present.
When it came down to the individual, we looked for two
things: preparation and motivation. Preparation asked if
they would be able to get from the school what we
intended them to get. So Eliana, for example, had little
experience writing and had not been part of a research
community before, so we wanted her to write a blog post
and find people she could work with.  Eliana is a good
example of us (I think successfully) picking a student who >
> did not have an impressive category theory background, but
who has, partly through the school (and very much
through her own skills and perseverance), become an
active and valued member of the community. Brad Theilman
also hadn't studied much category theory, but was good
mathematically, doing a neuroscience PhD, and had a very
strong recommendation. On the other hand, as well as
reading and explaining some of the more difficult papers, we
wanted people like you two to mix with each other and
get to know people like Pawel, mentor others, and move
to more senior roles in the community, like organising
workshops like this one. It takes a bit of boldness
to put your own values and assumptions behind the scenes
like this, but as long as it's in good faith and leadership
roles are appropriately shared I think it strengthens
the community, and I > > support you two doing the same.  >
